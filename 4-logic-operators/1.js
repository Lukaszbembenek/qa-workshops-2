const randomNumber = 58 * Math.random()

console.log(`randomNumber is ${randomNumber}`)
console.log(`randomNumber2 is ${randomNumber2}`)
// Using console.log see result of operations:
// Check if null and undefined are equal in both strict and abstract ways. What is the result?

// Check if "12" is more than 10

// Check if "false" and false are equal in both strict and abstract ways. What is the result?

// Using !! check what is boolean conversion of "false"

// Check if 0 and false are equal in both strict and abstract ways. What is the result?

// Check if randomNumber is more than 32, but lower than 100

// Check if randomNumber is less than 50 or if randomNumber is more than 120
